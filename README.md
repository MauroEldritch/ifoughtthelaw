# I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW LOST

This is it. My final chapter of the I fought the law... series.
We had a lot of fun mocking the "most modern police in the world".
But everything ends. Currently, this talk was translated to 3 languages:
Portuguese, Spanish and now English.

I really hope you enjoy reading it and discovering this story of corruption, lies, and spies (I'm looking at you Project X).

This talk was featured on many conferences:
