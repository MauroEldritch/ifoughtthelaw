# I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW LOST

This is it. My final chapter of the I fought the law... series.
We had a lot of fun researching the vulnerabilities of every Security/Armed Force in Argentina, but everything ends. 
Currently, this talk was translated to 4 languages:
Portuguese, Spanish, English and Russian.

I really hope you enjoy reading it and discovering this story of corruption, lies, hackers, and spies.

This talk was featured on many conferences:
