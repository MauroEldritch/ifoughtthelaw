# I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW LOST

This is it. My final chapter of the I fought the law... series.
We had a lot of fun mocking the "most modern police in the world".
But everything ends. Currently, this talk was translated to 3 languages:
Portuguese, Spanish and now English.

I really hope you enjoy reading it and discovering this story of corruption, lies, and spies (I'm looking at you Project X).

This talk was featured on many conferences:

|#| Date | Conference | Chapter | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1| JAN-2018 | XTREMESECURITY Brasil | Argentine Federal Police / Ministry of National Security Chapters | https://youtu.be/pHYb2NRDojw |
|2| FEB-2018 | ROADSEC Brasil | Buenos Aires City Police Chapter | https://youtu.be/larl83PcPKk |
|3| AUG-2018 | DEFCON Las Vegas | Final Chapter | TBD |

A heartfelt thanks for everyone who made this possible.
Specially, the crews from RECON VILLAGE @ DEFCON, XTREMESECURITY and ROADSEC/FLIPSIDE.
